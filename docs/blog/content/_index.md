Apollo is a music programming language built in Clojure. It is inspired by [Alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda). As I have an affinity for music, I chose this as my first project to get to grips with Clojure. It turned out to be quite an interesting project. Apollo is less ambitious than Alda, only providing basic functionality (and doing so rather inefficiently ðŸ˜†). I hope you enjoy reading more about it.
